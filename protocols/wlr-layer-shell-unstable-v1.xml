    <description summary="create surfaces that are layers of the desktop">
      Clients can use this interface to assign the surface_layer role to
      wl_surfaces. Such surfaces are assigned to a "layer" of the output and
      rendered with a defined z-depth respective to each other. They may also be
      anchored to the edges and corners of a screen and specify input handling
      semantics.

      <description summary="sets the size of the surface">
        Sets the size of the surface in surface-local coordinates. The
        compositor will display the surface centered with respect to its
        anchors.

        If you pass 0 for either value, the compositor will assign it and
        inform you of the assignment in the configure event. You must set your
        anchor to opposite edges in the dimensions you omit; not doing so is a
        protocol error.

        Both values are 0 by default.

    <request name="set_anchor">
      <description summary="configures the anchor point of the surface">
        Requests that the compositor anchor the surface to the specified edges
        and corners. If two orthogonally adjacent anchors are specified (e.g.
        'top' and 'left'), then the anchor point will be the intersection of the
        edges (e.g. the top left corner of the output); otherwise the anchor
        point will be centered on that edge, or in the center if none is
        specified.

        Anchor is double-buffered, see wl_surface.commit.

    <request name="set_exclusive_zone">
      <description summary="configures the exclusive geometry of this surface">
        Requests that the compositor avoids occluding an area of the surface
        with other surfaces. The compositor's use of this information is
        implementation-dependent - do not assume that this region will not
        actually be occluded.

        A positive value is only meaningful if the surface is anchored to an
        edge, rather than a corner. The zone is the number of surface-local
        coordinates from the edge that are considered exclusive.

        Surfaces that do not wish to have an exclusive zone may instead specify
        how they should interact with surfaces that do. If set to zero, the
        surface indicates that it would like to be moved to avoid occluding
        surfaces with a positive exclusive zone. If set to -1, the surface
        indicates that it would not like to be moved to accommodate for other
        surfaces, and the compositor should extend it all the way to the edges
        it is anchored to.

        For example, a panel might set its exclusive zone to 10, so that
        maximized shell surfaces are not shown on top of it. A notification
        might set its exclusive zone to 0, so that it is moved to avoid
        occluding the panel, but shell surfaces are shown underneath it. A
        wallpaper or lock screen might set its exclusive zone to -1, so that it
        stretches below or over the panel.

        Requests that the surface be placed some distance away from the anchor
        point on the output, in surface-local coordinates. Setting this value
        for edges you are not anchored to has no effect.

        The exclusive zone includes the margin.

        seat will always give exclusive keyboard focus to the top-most layer
        which has keyboard interactivity set to exclusive.

        Layer surfaces receive pointer, touch, and tablet events normally. If
        you do not want to receive them, set the input region on your surface

        the new surface.
